After months of putting it off, I'm transferring my domain and building a new personal page.

I had a few goals in doing so, the first being... I've learned a lot since I deployed my first Github Pages site. I've actually taken the time to (relatively) [grok](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grok_(disambiguation)) the intentions and workings of Git. I've started taking some back-end development courses. I've built and began hosting things on my personal homelab, including a whole development environment where, all good things willing, I am writing this post right now.

The first site that I made:

<a href="/oldsite.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="display: block; text-align: center;">
  <img src="/oldsite.png" alt="briananders.com, Theories of the Aetherplane" style="max-width: 500px; width: 100%; height: auto; padding: 1rem; display: inline-block;" />
</a>

Used a prebuilt Astro template called [Astro Paper](https://github.com/satnaing/astro-paper). It was good, snappy, worked well, feature rich... But it was too much for what I needed and it was kind of a pain to actually make posts. I tried integrating a back-end to simplify the posting process, but again... Kind of a pain. 

Anywho, I've since learned a lot about, just about everything... So I've worked to make my own theme this time, reminiscent of a Tabletop RPG Character Sheet, specifically the character sheet from one of my work in progress projects (Fables of the Twin Moons).

I'll keep this post pretty short, but I plan to continue to work on new development practices/principles. And actually use Git in the process of maintaining and working on this website, and keep a sort of ticker going, doing blog posts when I finish books and remove them from my currently reading, when I *finally* change out the CD in my car, or when I set up something to make posting to the website itself a bit easier or more straightforward (I'm thinking about doing some bash scripting to put together a template and open the file in NVIM and maybe automate some of the git processes for pushing to Github... We'll see.)

From there, the sky is the limit. My plan is to close down Briananders.com soon, I may migrate the posts, I may not.

Thanks for taking the time to read, hope you enjoy the site.
