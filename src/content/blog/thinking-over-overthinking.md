I'm bad at doing things the easy when when the easy way was invented by technical people.

Or at least that's what I'm starting to think.
Throughout the process of building this website I've been trying to learn various programming essentials... Well, not essentials, but you know, nice-to-haves. Git being the biggest one, still baffles me... If anyone has a good book to recommend on Git and Github I'll take it.

The way I've been handling programming thus far, and having a semi-standardized programming environment, has been SSHing into an Ubuntu server VM that I have configured for easily interacting with Github... I figure if I force myself to use it more, I'll get a better handle on doing so.

As such, I've been looking into how other's configure their environments and have determined that... most people think the idea of SSHing into a server to do all your programming there via terminal is what they would call... a bad idea. So I've been trying to standardize my "programming environment"... and writing scripts to do so... A script to install any packages I might need, a script to set up SSH and GPG for Github, a script to make sure that I've set up all of my dotfiles... I'm testing this all now in this very blog post, so we're going to see how it all works out.

The scripts will be available in my Github if they work, and I'm sure there will be plenty wrong with them, but... Hopefully they'll work.

Thanks for reading.
